<h3>Bio-</h3>
<p>Sara Hendren began her journey as a designer, receiving a masters (with distinction), in Art, Design, and the Public Domain, from Harvard Graduate School of Design.
   She later discovered engineering as a way to take design and produce things that impact peopleâ€™s lives. Sara mixes engineering and the arts to combat disability.
    Her work includes social design projects, graphic arts, and mixed media collaborations that engage technology and the human body.</p>
<h3>Design Engineering-</h3>
<p>A design engineer usually works with a team of engineers and other designers to develop conceptual and detailed designs that ensure a product actually functions, performs
  and is fit for its purpose. Design engineers are the bridge between making things that are extremely powerful and useful while still being aesthetic, and attractive to users.
  They also understand and communicate the architecture of complex problems; they study and engage a variety of situations with the technical and critical skills needed to
  design new products that solve hard problems.</p>
